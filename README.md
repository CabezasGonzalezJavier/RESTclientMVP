# About
  

    - This project:
        - MVP.
        - Mokito. I chose MVP(Model, View, Presenter),MVP pattern allows separate the presentation layer from the
        logic, so that everything about how the interface works is separated from how we represent it on screen.            JUnit and Mokito, It lets you write beautiful tests with clean & simple API.  The tests are very readable              and they produce clean verification errors.
